# Jupyter Notebook Examples

Introductory Jupyter Notebook examples using the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries.

## Requirements

Install:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jamilnyc/notebooks.git

# Enter the directory
cd notebooks/

# Start Jupyter Notebook Server
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the address printed by the last command (if it didn't automatically open) and open up one of the `*.ipynb` files. 
The `intro.ipynb` notebook is a good place to start.

## Tasks

- [ ] Make the `intro.ipynb` notebook a bit more generic with more examples of things you can do in a notebook
- [X] Add links to installation guides for software requirements
- [ ] Create a `numpy` notebook focusing on the `array` type
- [ ] Create a notebook with `seaborn`
